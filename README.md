# KvGnomeDarkMod
Full Plasma 6.x theme suite based on KvGnomeDark and Breeze widgets.

Deps:
- Klassy, for matching window decorations
- Kvantum, which also includes the KDE color scheme ("KvGnomeDark")
- Adwaita-dark theme (Some misbehaving WxGTK3 applications won't pick up the dark setting with the default theme)
- Papirus icon theme, or similar based on your preference

The Plasma theme SVGs are heavily edited from vanilla Breeze ones (which are the work of the KDE Visual Design Group) by heavily referencing the SVGs from the KvGnomeDark theme by Tsu Jan, which is included in [Kvantum](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum).

By combining these with the default/Adwaita dark theme in GTK 3 and 4, and a matching Klassy config for window decorations, you can get a reasonably "3D" looking desktop, similar to what was in vogue during 2008-2012.
